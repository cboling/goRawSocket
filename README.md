# goRawSocket

Refactoring of zsocket (github.com/newtools/zsocket) that supports the TPACKET_V2 interface
to allow for VLAN support. In addition, a Berkley Packet Filter can be supplied to filter
frames on the socket. Receive is performed on an Rx channel created by the caller.

See examples for how to use this implementation

## Development `make` targets

The `Makefile` contains many commands that are useful in development:

```
clean                     : Removes any local filesystem artifacts generated by a build
distclean                 : Removes any local filesystem artifacts generated by a build or test run
help                      : Print help for each Makefile target
lint-mod                  : Verify the Go dependencies
lint                      : Run all lint targets
mod-update                : Update go mod files
sca                       : Runs static code analysis with the golangci-lint tool
test                      : Run unit tests
```
